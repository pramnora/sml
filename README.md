## Introduction

I was looking through YouTube videos...when I came across a data type format called: SML/Simple MarkUp Lanugage;  
quite frankly, I couldn't help but feeling very deeply intrigued.

1. The YouTube videos do explain the concept quite logically, and, clearly.   
2. It appears to be a very good data type of format, indeed...; which has the capactity to communicate many different types of data.
3. They even have a web site...which you can visit to go learn more.
4. It appears to be non-propietary...; so the inventor/owner is 'unique'.
